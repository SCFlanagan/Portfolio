                    <p>I am a <strong>full stack software engineer</strong> based in <strong>Brooklyn, NY</strong>. I have a degree in Wildlife Conservation from the <strong>University of Massachusetts Amherst</strong>. My passion and dedication to conservation has afforded me some amazing opportunities. </p><br></br>
                    <p>Iâ€™ve had the chance to dodge fruit being thrown at me by endangered red uakari monkeys in the Amazon jungle, to induce a caiman to vomit so I could study its diet, and to traverse a stream, waders pulled up to my waist, sending electric shocks through the water to stun fish so I could record their measurements and take blood samples.</p><br></br>
                    <p>While I am still dedicated to conservation, over the last couple of years a new passion has ignited in me to code. I am addicted to the problem-solving, the perpetual learning, and the satisfaction gleaned from creating something from nothing. I am excited by the ever-changing landscape of tech, the never-ending supply of things to learn, and, most of all, by its potential to positively change the world. This new passion has afforded me its own exciting experiences, like the high I felt when I lost a game of Yahtzee to an AI player I had built.</p><br></br>
                    <p>I formalized my interest in code by attending <strong>Fullstack Academy</strong> in New York City. I am predominantly a JavaScript developer, but am eager and willing to learn new technologies and skills. I am particularly interested in writing game logic and creating intuitive and seamless user interfaces.</p><br></br>
